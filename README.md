# library
A browser library project accumulating many books. You can store them inside the library, find their page count and whether you have read them or not


## Thought process
1.All of the book objects are stored within an array.
2.There is also a Book Constructor Function that creates books.
3.There is also a separate function that takes input arguments and creates books from Book Constructor and stores the new books into the array.
4.Next, there is a function that loops though the array and displays each book to the page. It displays each object book in card form. 
5.There is a "new book" button that brings up a form, allowing users to input the details for the new book and add it to the library.
6.The user can also remove a book from the library.
7.There is also a button on each book's display to change its read status.
8.The library doesn't have yet any type of storage right now to save the information between page reloads.
