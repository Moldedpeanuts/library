# library
A browser library project accumulating many books. You can store them inside the library, find their page count and whether you have read them or not


##
All of the book objects are stored within an array.
There is also a Book Constructor Function that creates books.
There is also a separate function that takes input arguments and creates books from Book Constructor and stores the new books into the array.
