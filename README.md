## Project Overview

The Book Library allows users to:

- Add new books with details such as author, title, pages, and read status.
- Display a list of books stored in a dynamic array.
- Toggle the read status of books.
- Remove books from the list.

This project focuses on separating the logic for data storage and DOM manipulation, making it flexible for future enhancements, such as persisting data between page reloads.
